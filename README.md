# Presentation--Analyst-Profile

This repository contains a Beamer presentation I created on Potomac River flow and water quality data. The presentation was created for an assignment in SIS-750: Data Analysis, a course at the School of International Service, American University. My presentation seeked to explore flow, oxygen concentration, and nitrogen concentrations of the Potomac River over time for 2023. Data used in the analysis was downloaded from the United States Geological Servey (USGS). Data were daily readings and there are 365 observations.

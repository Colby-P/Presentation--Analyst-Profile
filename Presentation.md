# Slide deck and Presentation

**Due March 27**
Submit your recorded presentation electronically through Canvas.

## Presentation (8 pts)
This is a recorded audiovisual presentation meant to highlight your skills with visualization. The presentation must include a topical motivation, description of the data, and two slides of analysis. You must create the slide deck in R Markdown. The recording must include video of you and audio of your voice. The presentation must be 5-7 minutes in length. 

### Your slides
Given such a short window, keep it small:
- Title slide with topic and author info
- Data: describe the data you chose for the project
- Analysis 1: Show and describe the data on a key variable
- Analysis 2: Two visuals. Show and describe data on a second variable. Include a sub-group comparison as well.  

Analysis slides should include a visual representation of the data (e.g., bar chart, box plot, whatever) and basic information. The second analysis slide should feature a single visual with at least two plots. One should show the distribution for the full sample of data; the other should show a comparison across groups. Use `patchwork` or `facet` to create the plot. 

### How should I record this?
Try Zoom. Start a Zoom session. Check your audio and visual settings. Share your slides on the screen. Hit record, and deliver the presentation. Critically, you need to check the recording before you post. Did the sound come through clearly? Are the slides legible and on screen? Is it within the time limit?

### Expectations for quality
I will evaluate the presentation for clarity, completeness, and consistency. This includes slides, visuals (especially visual themes), and what you say. *I'm going to focus on the visualizations and visual themes.*

### What data should I use
No data from class or from a prior deliverable. Nothing with fewer than 100 observations. Beyond that, do what you want! Find something meaningful and/or interesting to you.

Got no time for that? Fine, consider some options.
- [Latinobarometro, 2018 data](https://www.latinobarometro.org/lat.jsp). Individual-level public opinion data across Latin America.
- [Urban Social Disorder Data 3.0](https://www.prio.org/data/32). Data on urban unrest in national capitols and major urban centers, 1960-2014
- [Global Greenspace Indicator Data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/TMWYHB). Data on greenspaces in over 1,000 urban areas globally.


## Peer feedback (2 pts)
Offer a constructive peer review of your classmatesâ€™ presentations. I will assign you two reviews at random. Watch each video carefully and offer useful feedback. Consider a few possible avenues for interaction:
- Was the central topic/motivation clear for a first-time viewer?
- Was the description of the data thorough and understandable?
- How effective are the visuals? Think about titles, use of color, sharpness of image, text size, etc.
- What do you think of the overall theme of the slides and visuals?

Your responses must be constructive (i.e., building toward a more refined portfolio) and respectful.  

Post your feedback via Canvas on or before April 1.
